We want to know if African monkeys can be taught about deadlocks. She locates a deep canyon and fastens a rope across it, so the monkeys can cross hand-over-hand.

Passage along the rope follows these rules:

Several monkeys can cross at the same time, provided that they are all going in the same direction.
If eastward moving and westward moving monkeys ever get onto the rope at the same time, a deadlock will result (the monkeys will get stuck in the middle) because it is impossible for one monkey to climb over another one while suspended over the canyon.
If a monkey wants to cross the canyon, he must check to see that no other monkey is currently crossing in the opposite direction.
